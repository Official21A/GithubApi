# Github-Api
Use "github" official api to get some data and modify it in "mathplotlib".

# Start
First you need to install 'requests' library on your system.

```
pip install requests
```

After that you need the url of Github api.

# Set
Basically you send a get request to that api and that api just responses
with a data. In our case the data is json.

After we get the data we collect the key data we need and then store them
in a dictionary.

# Output
We use plotlt to show the statistics in a plot.

First you need to install 'plotly' library on your system.

```
pip install plotly
```

After that you send the modified data to plotly.graph and it will create the plot for you.
